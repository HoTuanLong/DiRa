# DiRa car Software Setup Instructions


The documents contained in this repository provide all of the information required to setup, install and run a fully functional version of the DiRa source code. This instruction is provided for two compute box, Jetson TK1 and Jetson TX2


![alt text][note] Please contact us by opening an issue or emailing if you have any questions about the instructions, parts, or any part of the build process. My email: manhlinh.nguyendinh@gmail.com.

## Getting Started

Look though the documentation and [Download](https://github.com/fpt-corp/DiRa/tree/master/DiRa_Digital_Race_Software/Jetson_TX2/Image_Build) our latest release. Look over the Getting Started section in the chassis and compute box instruction documents, followed by the parts list and the operating procedures to get a sense of the build process, skill requirements, fabrication methods, and testing procedures. The DiRa car platform can be fabricated by a small team (3 - 5 students) of non-professionals. The build will go most smoothly if there is at least one person on the team familiar with basic soldering, 3D printing, Ubuntu and ROS configuration. We also link to tutorials for all of the skills required, so any interested party can easily acquire them.


Before testing a platform you build, make sure to complete the [Setup Instructions](https://github.com/fpt-corp/DiRa/tree/master/DiRa_Digital_Race_Software) and the [Platform Configuration Instructions - to be update soon](link).
