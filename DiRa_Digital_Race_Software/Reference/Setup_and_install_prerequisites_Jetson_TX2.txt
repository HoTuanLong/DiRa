ROS and other prerequisite installation on the JetsonTX2

<distro>: version of ros currently being used/installed
1. Install Ros
   - Choose the suitable version of ROS on the TX2: 
	+ Kinetic for Ubuntu 16.04
	+ Melodic for Ubuntu 18.04
and install following the instruction on the ROS official wiki: wiki.ros.org/<distro>/installation/Ubuntu
   *Note: During the installation process, errors may occured. This part will cover some possible ones
	- When using the command $sudo apt install ros-<distro>-desktop-full, get error:
	  E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open(11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
	  E: Unable to aquire the dpkg frontend lock
	This is due another process getting stuck or currently running
	=> Solution: 
		- Check running processes containing "apt" with: $ps aux | grep [a]pt
		- Wait a bit and check again if the process is still running or not. 
		  It could just be running and not stuck!
		- If the process is stuck, try killing it with $sudo kill -9 <process_id>. 
		  (The process ID is the first number on the output)
   - Setup the catkin workspace: 
	+ Use the following commands to create
		$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
	+ To compile the workspace, we should source the ROS environment to get access to ROS functions
		$ source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash
	+ Initialize a new catkin workspace
		$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
		$ catkin_init_workspace
	+ Build the workspace
		$ cd ~/catkin_ws
		$ catkin_make
	*Note: catkin_ws can be any workspace name you want
	+ Source the new setup.*sh file
		$ source devel/setup.bash
	+ To source the setup.*sh file everytime we start a new bash session, we use:
		$ echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
		$ source ~/.bashrc
	+ To ensure the workspace is properly overlay by the setup script
		$echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH /home/<user_name>/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/<distro>/share
	  this should return the same path
2. Install driver for astra camera
