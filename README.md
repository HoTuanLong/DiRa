We use Gitflow, so master branch is reserved for releases.

## **Contents**

1. [DiRa_Platform_Instructions](https://github.com/fpt-corp/DiRa/tree/master/DiRa_Platform_Instruction) - setup, construct, operate and assembley a complete physical Dira platform.
2. [DiRa_Software](https://github.com/fpt-corp/DiRa/tree/master/DiRa_Software) - software for DiRa research platform

The documents contained in this repository provide all of the information required to construct and operate a complete DiRa platform. The platform has two primary parts, the chassis and compute box. The platform has two version:  
* Pack1: ***Jetson TK1 with Scale AG car***
* Pack2: ***Jetson TX2 with Traxxas car***


### **DiRa Platform Instructions**

### Getting started
Look though the documentation and [Download Pack1](https://github.com/fpt-corp/DiRa/tree/master/DiRa_Software/Jetson_TK1/Image_Build) or [Download Pack2](https://github.com/fpt-corp/DiRa/tree/master/DiRa_Software/Jetson_TX2/Image_Build) for  our latest release. Look over the Getting Started section in the chassis and compute box instruction documents, followed by the parts list and the operating procedures to get a sense of the build process, skill requirements, fabrication methods, and testing procedures. The AutoRally platform can be fabricated by a small team (2-3 students) of non-professionals. The build will go most smoothly if there is at least one person on the team familiar with basic soldering, 3D printing, Ubuntu and ROS configuration. We also link to tutorials for all of the skills required, so any interested party can easily acquire them.

### Include folder:

1. Components - Spreadsheet of all parts required to build an DiRa Platform
2. Design_File - CAD models and 3d deisgn components.
3. Diagrams - Wiring diagrams for the custom DiRa car chassis and compute box assemblies.
4. Hardware - Product support and extent sensor to Jetson. Power by FPT.
5. Manuals - Product manuals for individual parts involved in the build.
